# Bank-Marketing-Analysis--Classification

### The dataset I have used comes from a marketing campaign, in which respondents are classified as "yes" (joined the bank) or "no", alongside information about each respondent (job, education, etc).
### The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the capabilities of Pycaret, an automated machine learning library. With very few lines of code it can quickly create models so that we can focus on proper data quality
### I have also consructed a Neural Network model with a single hidden layer. The results are satisfactory, with a Gini's coefficient of ~0.54.
